OsmAnd on the Apple Watch
==========

This is an extension for OsmAnd on iOS implementing an extension for the Apple Watch. The smartwatch app connects with OsmAnd and shows the current location on a zoomable map, no matter which map type was chosen on the iPhone. Additionally, if OsmAnd is in navigation mode, the navigation instructions for the current route are transmitted to the Apple Watch. These include the distance to the next waypoint as well as the direction in which one should move on. This directional instruction is also calculated in respect to the current walking direction. At each new waypoint that has been reached a subtle vibration on the wrist indicates a navigation update. Finally, each waypoint has a reverse geocoded street name, improving pedestrian navigation even further.
